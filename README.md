# Pubbly SchoolHouse

Cordova project for Swahili and English APK submissions.

## Structure

Original, the structure of the School House cordova project was to be determined from the Console itself. Each school was to have a grid based system, and each subject was to exist at a certain point in the grid. However, as the deadline approached, too many small changes were required, and so the application was half automated and half manually tweaked.
